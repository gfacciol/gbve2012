This MATLAB code provides an implementation for Sadek, Facciolo, Arias, Caselles,
"A variational model for gradient-based video editing.", Submitted IJCV, 2012.


There are four scripts in the current directory:
experiment_hand.m
experiment_cloth.m
experiment_bob.m 
experiment_bob_bc.m
each will load the sequences, optical flows and masks from the data directory  
and then run an experiment by calling vp.m.
The function vp.m (in the utils directory) implements the algorithm described in the paper.
This implementation corresponds to the re-writing of the energy described in 
the supplementary material: http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~rsadek/gbve/gbve_sup_mat.pdf

The parameters of the code are named as in the paper, and the argument "algo"
refers to the algorithm to be used. For instance BW_GBC uses the Backward
scheme with GBC Gradient Brigthness Change model Eq (20). FWBW_GBC minimizes
the energy with the hybrid scheme of Eq. (34), and FWBW_BC uses the Brightness 
Constancy model [16]:  \sum | h_v^even  u |^2.
